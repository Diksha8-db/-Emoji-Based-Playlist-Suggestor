🛠️ Built With

**HTML5**

**CSS3**

**JavaScript (Vanilla)**

**jQuery**

**✨ How It Works**
The user inputs an emoji or selects one from a predefined list.

JavaScript maps the emoji to a mood category (e.g., happy, sad, focussed, chilled).

A matching playlist is shown based on that category—locally stored.
